Introduction to MLflow
What is MLflow?
MLflow is an open source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle from start to finish.

MLflow is organized into four components: Tracking, Projects, Models, and Model Registry.Each of these components can be used independently. That means we can still track the model’s performance without exporting models in MLflow’s model format.

MLflow is designed to put as few constraints as possible and make codebase written in its format reproducible and reusable by multiple data scientists.
